![OwnTracks UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owntracks/frontend/master/docs/images/owntracks-ui.png)

## Introduction

This is a web interface for [OwnTracks](https://github.com/owntracks/recorder) built as
a Vue.js single page application. The recorder itself already ships with some basic web
pages, this is a more advanced interface with more functionality, all in one place.

![Map features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owntracks/frontend/master/docs/images/map-features.png)

## Features

- Last known (i.e. live) locations:
  - Accuracy visualization (circle)
  - Device friendly name and icon
  - Detailed information (if available): time, latitude, longitude, height, battery,
    speed and regions
- Location history (data points, line or both)
- Location heatmap
- Quickly fit all shown objects on the map into view
- Display data in a specific date and time range
- Filter by user or specific device
- Calculation of distance travelled
- Download selected location data as JSON
- Highly customisable

## Installation

### Docker

A pre-built Docker image is available on Docker Hub as [`owntracks/frontend`](https://hub.docker.com/r/owntracks/frontend).

You can start a container directly via `docker run`:

```console
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 -e SERVER_HOST=otrecorder-host -e SERVER_PORT=8083 owntracks/frontend
```

Or you can use `docker-compose` (if you also run the OwnTracks Recorder with the default
compose config, and the service is named `otrecorder`):

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  owntracks-ui:
    image: owntracks/frontend
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/custom/config.js:/usr/share/nginx/html/config/config.js
    environment:
      - SERVER_HOST=otrecorder
      - SERVER_PORT=8083
    restart: unless-stopped
```

To change the port on which the nginx server will listen on, set the
`LISTEN_PORT` enviroment variable - default is 80.

To build the image from source replace `image:` with:

```yaml
build:
  context: ./owntracks-frontend
  dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile
```

(assuming you have this repository cloned to `owntracks-frontend` in the same
directory as `docker-compose.yml`)

### Manually

- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn build` to compile and minify for production
- Copy the content of the `dist/` directory to your webroot

## Configuration

It's possible to get started without any configuration change whatsoever, assuming your
OwnTracks API is reachable at the root of the same host as the frontend.

Copy [`public/config/config.example.js`](public/config/config.example.js) to
`public/config/config.js` and make changes as you wish.

See [`docs/config.md`](docs/config.md) for all available options.

## Development

- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn serve` to compile for development and start the hot-reload server
- Run `yarn lint:js` to lint JavaScript/Vue files
- Run `yarn lint:md` to lint Markdown files
- Run `yarn format:js` to format JavaScript/Vue files
- Run `yarn format:md` to format Markdown files
- Run `yarn test` to run unit tests

### CORS-Proxy

You can use the [`corsProxy.js`](scripts/corsProxy.js) script to use your production
instance of OwnTracks for development without making changes to its CORS-Headers:

```console
$ yarn cors-proxy
```

If you have [basic authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#Basic_authentication_scheme)
enabled, create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```text
OT_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=user
OT_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD='P@$$w0rd'
```

Then run:

```console
$ env $(cat .env | xargs) yarn cors-proxy
```

The default host and port it binds to is `0.0.0.0:8888`. Change using the `OT_PROXY_HOST`
and `OT_PROXY_PORT` environment variables.

Finally update `api.baseUrl` in your config to `"http://0.0.0.0:8888/https://owntracks.example.com"`.

### I18n

This project uses [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/). To see missing and
unused i18n entries, run:

```console
$ yarn i18n:report
```

To add a new locale, copy `en.json` to `<locale>.json` in [`src/locales`](src/locales)
and start translating the individual strings. Make sure to [mention the new locale to the docs](docs/config.md#locale)!

For a specific example see commit [`b2edda4`](https://github.com/owntracks/frontend/commit/b2edda410f16633aa6fd9cd4e5250f2031536c7d)
where German translations were added.
